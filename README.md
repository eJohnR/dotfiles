# ...dotfiles

These are a collection of dotfiles for use with vim, tmux, and zsh. Inspired
by [@Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), they are broken
down into modules to be symlinked to your home directory from the .dotfiles
folder.

Example:  
Symlinking the .vimrc.symlink file to your home directory.
```
ln -s $PWD/.vimrc.symlink $HOME/.vimrc
```

TODO: Include script to do all the hardwork (symlinking).
