# ...dotfiles

These are a collection of dotfiles for use with vim, tmux, and zsh. Inspired
by [@Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), they are broken down into modules to be symlinked to
your home directory from the .dotfiles folder.

Example:

   ln -n $PWD/.vimrc.symlink $HOME/.vimrc
